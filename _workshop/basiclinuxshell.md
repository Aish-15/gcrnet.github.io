## Introduction
Linux commands are issued to a computer program called
`shell`. The shell enables us to send commands to the
computer and receive output. It is also referred to as
the terminal or command line. Some computers include a
default Unix Shell program. If not natively present, a
programs called Linux/Unix emulator can be installed to
access a Unix Shell on a server.

## Setup
Download [data-shell.zip](http://swcarpentry.github.io/
shell-novice/data/data-shell.zip) and move the file to
your Desktop. Unzip/extract the file. You should have a
new folder called `data-shell` on your Desktop.
Open a terminal. If youâ€™re not sure how to open a
terminal in your operating system, see the instructions
below. In the terminal type `cd` then press the 'Return'
key. This step will make sure you start with your home
folder as your working directory. Later on, you will
find out how to access the data files in this folder.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)
Computers with Windows operating systems~(OS) older than
Windows 10 do not have the Bash shell installed by default.
If you have a Windows OS older than Windows 10, we encourage
you to use an emulator included in Git for Windows, which
gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git. Once
installed, you can open a terminal by running the program Git
Bash from the Windows start menu.

Additionally, you can run Bash commands from a remote
computer or server that already has a Unix Shell. This
can usually be done through a Secure Shell (SSH) client.
One such client available for free for Windows computers
is PuTTY. See the **reference** below for information on
installing and using PuTTY, using the Windows 10 command-line
tool, or installing and using a Unix/Linux emulator.

**Reference**
  * [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) - Recommended           
**For advanced users, you may choose one of the following alternatives**:                 
  * [Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
  * [Using a Unix/Linux emulator (Cygwin) or Secure Shell (SSH) client (Putty)](http://faculty.smu.edu/reynolds/unixtut/windows.html)      
Please note that commands in the Windows Subsystem for Linux or Cygwin may differ slightly from those shown in the lesson or presented in the workshop.

### [macOS](#tab/macOS)
For a Mac computer running macOS Mojave or earlier
releases, the default Unix Shell is Bash. For a Mac
computer running macOS Catalina or later releases,
the default Unix Shell is `Zsh`. Your default shell is
available via the Terminal program within your Utilities
folder. To open Terminal, try one or both of the following:
  * In Finder, select the Go menu, then select Utilities. Locate Terminal in the Utilities folder and open it.
  * Use the Mac `Spotlight` computer search function. Search for: `Terminal` and press `Return`.

To check if your machine is set up to use something other than Bash, type `echo $SHELL` in your terminal
window.
           
If your machine uses something other than Bash, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing
`bash`.

#### [Linux](#tab/Linux)
The default Unix Shell for Linux operating systems is
usually Bash. On most versions of Linux, it is accessible
by running the [Gnome Terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/)
or [KDE Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) or [xterm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm),
which can be found via the applications menu or the
search bar. If your machine is set up to use something
other than Bash, you can run it by opening a terminal
and typing bash.        

This workshop will not make you an expert but will provide you with a good
enough foundation for a personal exploration the Unix shell. The shell has
a very rich echo system of commands but we will only touch on those deemed
essential for scientific computing. The lesson is structured as follows:

1. [Introducing the Shell](#TheShell)
2. [Navigating Files and Directories](#FilesDirectories)
3. [Pipes and Filters](#PipesFilters)
4. [Finding Things](#FindThings)
