We can use a Jekyll theme and write our posts using markdown using less amount of HTML and CSS and have a awesome responsive good looking website.
If you are a developer and you love crerating websites and want to control every single aspect of the HTML and CSS on your site we can do all that with jekyll. 
Jekyll allows us to create our own themes and layouts etc... we can controll and configure the enire site.
