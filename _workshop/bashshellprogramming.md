|**Duration**       | 2 hour workshop (~2 hours of trainer-led time)                                |

## Description

This workshop is planned to last for 2 hours. It is a live coding
workshop and participants are expected to practise along
with the instructor. Lessons will focus on using the command-line
text editor, Vim, to create and edit files, utilizing for-loops for
automation, using variables to store information, and writing scripts
to perform a series of commands in a sequential order.

## Learning Objectives

* Learning basic operations using the Vim text editor
* Capturing previous commands into a script to re-run with one single command
* Understanding variables and storing information
* Learning how to use variables to operate on multiple files

This workshop is designed on the model developed by the [Software and Data
Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/workshops/). The material on this page is
part from the [Software Carpentry Lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)


## Setup
Download [data-shell.zip](http://swcarpentry.github.io/
shell-novice/data/data-shell.zip) and move the file to
your Desktop. Unzip/extract the file. You should have a
new folder called `data-shell` on your Desktop.
Open a terminal. If youâ€™re not sure how to open a
terminal in your operating system, see the instructions
below. In the terminal type `cd` then press the 'Return'
key. This step will make sure you start with your home
folder as your working directory. Later on, you will
find out how to access the data files in this folder.

[Follow the instructions here to set up your operating system](https://gcrnet.github.io/workshop/basiclinuxshell.html#Windows)

## Basic Shell Commands    

Below is a key of the basic commands you should be familiar with in order to be able to follow this module.

ls            # list contents of current or specified directory
man <command> # display manual for specified command
pwd           # specify present working directory
echo "..."    # display content in quotes on the standard output
history       # display previous "historical" commands
cat <file>    # display all contents of a file on the standard output
less <file>   # open a buffer with the contents of a file
head <file>   # display the first 10 lines of a file
tail <file>   # display the last 10 lines of a file
cp <..> <..>  # copy files or directories
mdkir         # make a new directory/folder
mv <..> <..>  # move or rename files or directories
rm <file>     # remove a file or a folder (-r)

## Other
~             # home directory
.             # current directory
..            # parent directory
*             # wildcard
ctrl + c      # cancel current command
ctrl + a      # start of line
ctrl + e      # end of line
