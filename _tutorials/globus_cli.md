The Globus CLI is a Python-based application that must be installed on the computer systems at both ends of your file transfer. It requires a Python version of at least 2.7 or 3.3, as well as the Python "pip" command.

1. [Installation](#install)
2. [Logging in into Globus](#login)

The Globus website provides [CLI installation](https://docs.globus.org/cli/installation/) instructions that cover all types of operating systems. It also includes instructions for updating and removing the CLI. This page follows the recommendations from the Globus site, while only giving instructions for installing on XSEDE resources and assuming that you are running the Bash shell. When installed, the CLI will be added to your shell path and will automatically be available when you log in again. <br>

Before you can use the Globus CLI on a given computer, you must log in to Globus.
