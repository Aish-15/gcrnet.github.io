404.html -
The HTTP error 404, or more commonly called "404 error", means that the page you are trying to open could not be found on the server. This is a client-side incident which means either the page has been deleted or moved, and the URL has not been modified accordingly, or that you have misspelled the URL    

Gemfile -
A Gemfile describes the gem dependencies required to execute associated Ruby code. Place the Gemfile in the root of the directory containing the associated code.

Gemfile.lock -
The Gemfile. lock file is where Bundler records the exact versions that were installed. This way, when the same library/project is loaded on another machine, running bundle install will look at the Gemfile. ... Running different versions on different machines could lead to broken tests, etc.

LICENSE 

_config.yml -
The main configuration file for the IQ Server installation is a YAML formatted file called config. yml found in the installation directory. The config. yml file typically contains only those configuration options which are rarely changed.
